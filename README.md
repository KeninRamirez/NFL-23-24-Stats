# Ask
### Business Task

Determine the key statistical factors that have the greatest impact on securing victories.

### Guiding Questions

1. What topic am I exploring?
2. What is the problem I am trying to solve?
3. What metrics will I use to measure my data to achieve my objective?
4. Who are/is the stakeholders/audience?
5. How can my insights help make decisions?

# Prepare
### Data Source

I will use Pro Football References' data to analyze and identify trends from the 2023-2024 NFL season which can be downloaded from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/).

### Data Organization
There are 6 files I used (AFC Standings, NFC Standings, Team Offense, Kick & Punt Returns, Kicking, and Team Defense) when performing my analysis. All files include relevent stat information from all games played within the season. For example, AFC and NFC Standings includes general information such as: Team (T), Wins (W), Losses (L), Points For (PF), Points Against (PA), etc., where as Team Offense includes information such as: Offensive Ranks (Off Rank), Yards Gained (Yds Gained), Offensive Yards per Play (Off Y/P), etc.

### Data Credibility
The data is original and comes from a reliable organization, comprehensive, current, and cited.
